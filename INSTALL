Logcheck Installation
---------------------

If you are running Debian, you will benefit from installing the .debs
Otherwise, perform a manual install like this.

! These instructions are likely incomplete.  If you had to do something
different, please contact the logcheck team at 
logcheck-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org.

-Extract logcheck and run make install.
-Add an unpriviliged user for running logcheck. (typicallly named "logcheck")
-chown -R logcheck /etc/logcheck /var/lock/logcheck /var/lib/logcheck
-Be sure this user can access your log files
-Edit logcheck configuration files in /etc/logcheck.  Most importantly
logcheck.conf.  logcheck.logfiles contains a list of logfiles to be scanned.

To test your installation run "logcheck -ot"
