logcheck for Debian
-------------------

As of version 1.1.9.1 the Logcheck scripts has had a major overhaul by
myself.  This extends the options in the config file that Rene
Mayrhofer introduced in version 1.1.1-7.

The major changes between 1.1.9.1 and 1.1.1-13.5 include the following
 - Comments are now allowed in rulefiles
 - Subdirectories in the rulefile directories are ignored
 - Security violation mails now have a different subject
 - There is now support for cracking.ignore (for local use only).
   This needs to be enabled in the config file
 - Lines logged in one section will not appear in any others
 - Standard rulefiles are now stored in the .d directories
 - We do not support symlinks in the .d directories any more
 - Shortened report subjects (can be changed in the config file)
 - Logcheck no longer installs any symlinks under /etc/logcheck
 - Package-specific rulefiles in violations.ignore.d only filter
   alarms raised by the corresponding violations.d entry
 - Package-specific Security Violations now get separate sections

I have made this a Debian native package now, due to the vast
difference between upstream's 1.1.1 and Debian's version.
