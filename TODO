* Extend dh_installlogcheck

  Check for invalid expressions at install time.

  Detects if it is working against logcheck in sid or woody
    1. For logcheck in sid, just output the files to their proper levels

    1. For logcheck in woody, strip out comments and combine the levels
       so as to emulate what logcheck in sid does with them

* Re-write regression test suite

   Use PyTest.
   Expand the tests.
   Remove duplicate configs and rules in test.

* Overhaul Section titles (post sarge release)

   Rename "Attack Alerts" to "Security Violations" ?
   Rename some of the .d directories.

* Re-write logtail in c

   Needs to handle rotated files it self
   Use a BDB (?) database for storing file offsets
   Have roll back support
   Store full path to the log file (unmodified)

* Makefile

   Add DOCDIR
   Enhance it for non Debian Distribution

* Misc

  get sane logic in greplogoutput() to prevent from duplicate ignore runs.
  logoutput needs too to be sanitized, eventually logtail will to more.

  Add syslog-ng rotation support such that:
  < weasel> i.e. rotating to syslog.1 and immediately compressing that
  < weasel> so that we have  log/syslog  (current)  and  log/syslog.1.gz

* Debian Package, post sarge
  Switch dh_movefiles to dh_install in rules, include header.
  Use package.manpages, call dh_installman once in rules. 
  Web-based rule submission, with sanity checks.
  Split logcheck-database from source package to simplify maintenance.
  Move rulefile permission fixes to logcheck-database postinst.
